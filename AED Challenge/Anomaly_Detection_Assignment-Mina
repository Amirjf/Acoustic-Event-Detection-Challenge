### Read section 2.2 of Chandola et al. Answer the following question, in the context of the analysis of sound from say 250 sleeping rooms, monitored from a single location, what category of anomaly do the following situations constitute?

**Patient singing at 2 AM**: Since the patient sings at 2 AM (not at other times of the day) in a sleeping room, it is a "Contextual Anomaly" (such as an investigation in a temperature time series and observing 35Â°F being normal in winter but abnormal in summer).

**Aggressive shouting**: This is a rare behavior (without time and location consideration) compared to normal behavior, so it is a "Point Anomaly" (such as credit card fraud detection).

**May 4 commemoration of the dead**: Since the behavior of a huge number of people changes on that night (not only one or a few of them), it is a Collective Anomaly (such as human electrocardiogram output in which low value exists for an abnormally long time).


### If you had a contextual anomaly as category in the above question, then point out the contextual and behavioral attributes.
For the "Patient Singing at 2 AM":
- **Contextual Attributes**:
  - Time: 2 AM
  - Location: Sleeping room
- **Behavioral Attributes**:
  - Singing: Which is a normal behavior that becomes anomalous in this specific context due to it's specific contextual Attributes.
