# Acoustic Event Detection Challenge (AED)

### Main Assignment for Applied Machine Learning

This repository contains our **Acoustic Event Detection Challenge** project, part of an Applied Machine Learning course. The central theme is analyzing audio data from the **ESC-50** dataset, extracting meaningful features, and applying machine learning algorithms (both supervised and unsupervised) to classify environmental sounds effectively.

## Overview & Assignment Description

### The Acoustic Event Detection Challenge

In many nursing homes, acoustic monitoring is used to detect potential alarms or anomalies. However, simple detection methods based on **sound intensity** and **duration** often result in high false-alarm rates, while some short-lived but important events may be missed.

**Goal**:

- Develop machine learning solutions that **classify** or **detect** specific acoustic events.
- Use the **ESC-50** dataset (environmental sound recordings) to explore data from **10 classes** chosen from **5 different categories**.

The **main research question** guiding this project is:

> **Can we infer the source of a sound recording from extracted features?**

**Subquestions** include:

1. How can we define a suitable set of features?
2. Which algorithms can be used to solve this task?
3. How does performance depend on algorithm choice and their parameters?
4. How does performance depend on feature extraction parameters?
5. How well do supervised algorithms perform against unsupervised algorithms for the task?

## Main Assignment Steps

Below is a concise outline of the tasks:

### 1. Understanding Your Data

1. **Read in only the .wav files you want**
   - From **10 classes** (2 classes from each of the 5 categories in ESC-50).
   - Use **pandas** or any filtering strategy (e.g., look for a specific end-number) to get the desired files.
2. **Visualize an instance of each class**
   - For example, plot a **spectrogram** or **spectrum** to get an overview of the data.

### 2. Extracting Features (Individually Graded)

1. **Extract lower-dimensional features** (e.g., binned histograms from banded spectrograms, MFCCs, etc.).
2. **Create variations of these features** (e.g., different distributions of bin edges, different bandings for spectrograms).
3. **Save out results to NPZ files** so re-generation of features is not required for each run.

### 3. Modeling Your Data (Algorithm Development)

1. **Split your features** into **training** and **test** sets (80:20).
2. **Further split** the **training data** into **train and validation** sets (folds).
3. **Fit your model** on the train data and vary model parameters:
   - **SVM**: Kernel type, C, Gamma
   - **K-means**: Number of clusters
4. **Use the validation data** to assess parameter performance (using ROC, AUC).
5. **Select** a subset of models based on performance (e.g., linear SVM with feature_set1, RBF SVM with feature_set2, K-means with 10 clusters, etc.).

### 4. Comparing Your Models

1. **Use the test set** to calculate metrics (Accuracy, TPR, FPR, etc.).
2. **Plot** these on a coverage plot (or any chosen metric visualization).
3. **Write a commentary** discussing performance (possibly include confusion matrices).
